SiriTunes is a Siri Proxy plugin that allows you to play, pause, adjust the volume, skip to the next/previous track, and request specific songs, albums, and artists in iTunes on a Windows PC.

SiriTunes was created by parm289.  You are free to use, modify, and redistribute this gem as long as proper credit is given to the original author.

Usage:
	Generally, you'll need to preface each request with "iTunes."  This avoids conflicts with Siri's control of the iPhone's internal music app.  The currently implemented commands are (with alternative commands in []):
		"iTunes, play [put on] _____" (where ____ is a song title, artist, or album) - Plays a specific song, artist or album.
		"iTunes, play" - Plays/unpauses iTunes (equivalent to clicking the play button in the iTunes appliation).
		"iTunes, pause" - Pauses iTunes.
		"iTunes, next [previous] song" - Skips to the next/previous song.
		"iTunes, raise [lower] the volume" - Raises/lowers the iTunes volume.

		
Installation (untested):
	To install SiriTunes, edit your Siri Proxy config.yml file to include the parameters listed in SiriTunes' config-info.yml file.  Then, run "bundle install" in your Siri Proxy directory to install the SiriTunes gem.
